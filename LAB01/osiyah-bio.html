    Iam Michelle Osiyah.
    My major is Information management and Technology, concentrating in Information Security. I have a close interest in learning how to keep our information secure and understanding how the CIA Triad can be implemented in every decision we make. 
    Outside class work, I enjoy binging on old TV series, started going to the gym, and love cooking. I am also navigating adulting and honestly it is ridiculous. The taxes, bills on utilities, rent. Its a lot but we wanted to grow up so bad right?
    I love travel, and good street food too.
