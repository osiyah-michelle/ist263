        <h1>Schine Student Center: What you need to know</h1>
        <h2>February, 1 2022 </h2>
        <p> The transformed Hildegarde and J. Myer Schine Student Center is a welcoming, inclusive and fully accessible gathering place designed to further enhance the student experience. A cornerstone of Syracuse University's Campus Framework, the center's renovation creates an open and inviting atmosphere housing our diverse cultural centers and the offices of Student Activities and Student Centers and Programming Services, and providing a more visible location for our student organizations. With a lively two-floor atrium, new seating options for the dining area and other modern amenities, the center will serve as the hub of student life at Syracuse University. </p>
